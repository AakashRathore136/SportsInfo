Sports Information Web Application

This repository contains a static, multilingual sports information website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application presents content for multiple sports and supports three languages:

->English (en)

->Hindi (hi)

->Tamil (ta)

The focus of this project is simplicity, clarity, and basic multilingual structure.

Project Structure
    assets/        Shared CSS and JavaScript files  
    en/            English version of all pages

    ta/            Tamil version of all pages  
    index.html     Main landing page  


Each language folder contains its own set of localized HTML pages. Styling and UI behavior are shared across all languages via the assets directory.

Implementation Details

This approach keeps the project easy to understand and run, at the cost of some content duplication.
